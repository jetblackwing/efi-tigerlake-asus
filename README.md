## Before installing

This EFI is originally created by olarila.com and support included by nootedblue (all credit goes to him). This EFI contains of both patched and unpatched libraries, which some of them are working now except graphics (TigerLake Iris-Xe). For the time being, the support for tigerlake laptops are in hold because the original developers lack time. In addition to that, macOS discontinued the support for Intel based chips since 10th gen processors.
